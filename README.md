# SAVANA_API
SAVANA: Secure AI Verification And Non-deceptiveÂ Analysis

SAVANA API, encompassing four key features: image deepfake detection, video deepfake detection, AI content detection in research papers, and AI content detection in blogs. Utilizing advanced machine learning models and natural language processing techniques, our system ensures reliable and accurate identification of AI-generated content, thus enhancing the integrity and trustworthiness of digital media. The proposed methodology includes the use of BlazeFace for face detection, EfficientNetB4 for regression tasks, fine-tuned vectorizers with logistic regression for text analysis, and LLaMA 3 for nuanced linguistic pattern detection. This study outlines the technical aspects and experimental results of each feature, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in combating deceptive AI content.


## Abstract
This project presents the design and implementation of a comprehensive system for secure AI verification and non-deceptive analysis. Our system encompasses four key features:
1. Image Deepfake Detection
2. Video Deepfake Detection
3. AI Content Detection
4. AI Content Detection in Research Papers
5. AI Content Detection in Blogs
-This README outlines the technical aspects and provides an overview of the experimental results for each feature, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in combating deceptive AI content.

## Features

### 1. Image Deepfake Detection
Detects manipulated images using BlazeFace for face detection and EfficientNetB4 for the regression tasks.

### 2. Video Deepfake Detection
Analyzes videos to identify deepfake content by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.

### 3. AI Content Detection in Research Papers
Employs fine-tuned vectorizers and logistic regression to detect AI-generated content in academic research papers.

### 4. AI Content Detection in Blogs
Uses LLaMA 3 to analyze and identify AI-generated content in blogs, ensuring the authenticity of the text.
